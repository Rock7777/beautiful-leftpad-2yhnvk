#VS Code learnings

Making better use of VS code:

shorcuts:

Ctrl+P --> recently open files or search for files - I know it

I can use Quokka.js extension which gives out output of JS code in the code itself --> will try it in my personal app

To navigate through the entire file for getting entire content of file like functions and variable used --> use @ after using Ctrl + P 
and then u can find out --> this is better than Ctrl + F and direct shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+.

to go to certain use Ctrl+G followed by line number

to edit multiple occurences at a time use Ctrl + D and the n start typing

to automatically get the closing tag for opening tag use extension Auto Rename Tag

to move line of code upper or lower use Alt + top/down arrow keys
to copy and move tat line of code upper or lower use Alt + Shift + top/down arrow keys

Open a new terminal -> Ctrl + ` , to clear out terminal use Ctrl + K
