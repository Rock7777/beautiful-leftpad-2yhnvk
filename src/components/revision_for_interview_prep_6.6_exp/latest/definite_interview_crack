  # qns_to_must_know

  definite questions to know and be aware of:

Prep for internal oppurtunity(RC):

questions tat can come:

1. explain differences between var,let and const?
solution:
var - function scope  in hoisting variable declared - if tried to access before itself - we get undefined
let , const - block scope - if tried to access before itself - we et Reference error

2. how do u manage state in React? can u describe difference between locAL component state and global state
   management(using Redux , context api etc)

Solution: see state is handled using hooks especially in functional components

there is still answer to it , I will add it

3. how do u optimize performance of a react app?

solution: 
1.making use of lazy loading in order to load multimedia huge files later
2.making use of useMemo and useCallback when required
3. making use of pure components(output doesn't change if there is no change in state or props)
4. making use of fragments bcoz they do not add extra nodes to DOM tree.


there is still answer to it , I will add it


4. what are advs of using virtual DOM in react?

Sol: main reason why we got to using react is bcoz of virtual dom, it is lightweight copy of actual real dom.
it makes use of diffing algorithm and makes changes tat have only changed to real DOM avoiding unnecesaary 
overhead. React maintains two virtual DOM's

5. how do u implement responsive design in web application?
Solution: by using media queries , need to check later


6. wat is difference between class and functional component in react.
sol: 1. syntax referring to class keyword and function keyword
     2. use of render in class method and not in functional
     3. use of this in class component in order to bind functions to constructor which is not needed in 
        functional component.
     4. use of hooks in functional components where as we use lifecycle methods like 
        componentDidMount in class components

7. can u explain concept of hooks in React and give examples of commonly used hooks like useState,useEffect anD
   useContext?

sol: hooks are functions tat enable us to use life cycle methods in functional components
   I know all these hooks - so its done

8.wat is purpose of key prop in React?

sol: key is a special attribute which is used to uniquely identify items in lists. 
it is essential in case of mutating the lists

9. how do u handle form validation in react applns?
solution: 
first for the elements like text box we add event handler which makes sure tat we are controlling it
we can add checks in it like whether input we are receiving from user is matching it or not
similarly how we make use of onSubmit handler when we submit a form

I need to check the above

10. how do u approach cross-browser compatibility issues with CSS?

solution: I need to check

11. wat are css preprocessors like Sass or LESS, how do they improve ur development workflow?

solution: I need to check

12. wat is flexbox, and how is it different from CSS grid?

solution: 
.flexbox is one of the layouts how we can design our web appln , the model is we have content
surrounding it we have padding and then border and then finally margin
.Using flexbox we can stack elements either horizontally or vertically in grid elements are arranged in forms of
rows and columns , I need to check on this.

13. can u explain event delegation and its advs in web development?
solution: event delegation means generally giving control to something else
        need to check
                                 
# 20 definite qns_to_crack_boeing

  definite 20 questions to know to crack for boeing client

I will provide answers only for those which I am not sure of

1. what is virtual DOM and how does it differ from real DOM?

Solution: algorithm used is diffing I know the rest

2. what are React hooks? Can you explain useState and useEffect?

Solution: I know

3. explain the concept of component lifecycle in React. how is it handled
   in functional components?
Solution: I know

4.what is React context api? how does it differ from prop drilling?

Solution: Context api provides a way to share data globally across component tree I know

5. what are controlled and uncontrolled components?

Solution: Controlled components are where form data are controlled by react state
form data is handled by DOM itself - uncontrolled components

6. what are React fragments and who do we use them?

Solution: React fragments are useful when we need to group multiple elements without needing to add extra nodes to DOM.
they are useful when we need to render multiple elements without addition of extra div's or other html elements which will cause 
styling issues.

eg for fragment: return(<><h1>Hello!!</h1></>)

7. explain concept of React's key prop in lists? why is it important?

Solution: I know

8. what is difference between useMemo and useCallback?
Solution: I know

Note: 
1.in index.js this is how we import App.js

index.js:

import App from './App'
import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client"

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")
const root = createRoot(rootElement)

root.render(<React.StrictMode><App/></React.StrictMode>)

2. what is use of strictmode and why do we need it?

Solution:  strictmode is a wrapper component which only runs in development , it doesn't affect production , it helps you write safe code.

it detects unsafe lifecycle methods like componentWillUpdate , deprecated api's like findDOMnode

9. what are higher order components?

Solution: 


10. explain error boundary?




11. what are pure components?

the components which render the same output if the state and props doesn't change , they make unnecessary re-renders not possible.
they implement shouldComponentUpdate method by default but by doing shallow comparison of state and props , only if the 
shallow comparison of state and props if there is a change then only re-render occurs which is not case with regular component.

code I am just writing the skeleton

example :

parentcomponent.js

constructor(){
this.state ={
name: 'Rock'}}

componentDidMount(){
setInterval(()=>{
this.setState({
name: ''Rock})},2000)
}

render() {
console.log('ParentComponent render')
return(
<PureComponent1 name={this.state.name}/>
<Regular Component name={this.state.name}/>
)
}

App.js

render()
{
  return(
  <ParentComponent/>
)
}

PureComponent1.js

class PureComponent1 extends PureComponent{
render() {
console.log('PureComponent render')
return(
<h1>Pure - {this.props.name}</h1>
)
}
}

RegularComponent.js

class  RegularComponent extends React.Component{
render() {
console.log('RegularComponent render')
return(
<h1>Regular - {this.props.name}</h1>
)
}
}

As u can see above the name is not changed after every 2 sec in parent component but after 2 sec
we will see in console log both stmts from parent and Regular component but from Pure as it does a shallow comparison of
props and state and sees tat there is no change and hence re-rendering will not occur

Node js definite must know 20 qns?

Very very important:

find the closest element to zero from array : a1=[-4,-2,1,4,2]

Solution:

closest element to zero means whose absolute value is smallest



const a1=[-4,-2,1,4,2,-1]
let closest = a1[0]
for(let i=0;i<a1.length;i++) {
    if(Math.abs(a1[i]) < Math.abs(closest) 
      || (Math.abs(a1[i] === Math.abs(closest) && a1[i] > closest)))
    {
        closest = a1[i]
    }
}

// Rule is if two numbers are closest to zero choose the positive one
console.log(closest)

1.function returns an object in jest how can we write test cases in jest

Solution:


getUserData.js:

const getUserData = (id)=>
{
  if(id === 1) {
  return {userId: 1, name:"Rock1", info:"Rock1 info"}
}
else if(id === 2) {
  return {userId: 2, name:"Rock2", info:"Rock2 info"}
}
else {
  return {userId: null, name:null, info:null}
}
}

export default getUserData

getUserData.test.js

import {getUserData} from "./getUserData"

describe("getUserData",()=>
{
  it("should return correct user object userId 1",()=>
{
  const result = getUserData(1)
  expect(result).toEqual({userId: 1, name:"Rock1", info:"Rock1 info"})
});

it("should display the correct info for id 2",()=>
{
  const result = getUserData(2)
  expect(result).toEqual({userId: 2, name:"Rock2", info:"Rock2 info"});
});

it("should display the null for unspecified id",()=>
{
  const result = getUserData(3)
  expect(result).toEqual({userId: null, name:null, info:null});
});
})



if jest not installed , npm install --save-dev jest

in package.json --> "scripts" : {"test" : "jest"}

run : npm test
  

2. write code for pagination in react js and by default it should load a page and onclick of particular page it 
   has to show 5 records pertaining to tat page and it should have next and previous button 


Solution:

onLoad - it has to by default show the mentioned no.of records in tat page , by default
it should be page 1
on navigating to different page data should be loaded dynamically

3.how to reverse an array without using reverse method

Solution:

const s1 = "Rakesh earns 1cr"
const a1 = s1.split(" ")
console.log("array",a1)
let reversedArray = []
for(let i=a1.length-1;i>=0;i--)
{
    console.log(a1[i])
    reversedArray.push(a1[i])
}
const a2 = reversedArray.join(" ")
console.log("a2:",a2) // 1cr earns Rakesh


4.in typescript how do we write result of three numbers
  
Sol: function sum(num1:number,num2:number,num3:number) : number {
    return num1 + num2 + num3
}

const p2 = sum(10,3,4)
console.log("Sum:",p2)

// Output: Sum: 17

Important Note : 

In typescript we define types to function arguments or return type explicitly like above for a function



5.how to reverse words in an array from string

Sol: 

using reverse method in javascript reversing order of words

const s1 = "Rakesh earns 1cr"
const a1=s1.split(" ")
console.log("Array:",a1.reverse().join(' ')) // --> 1cr earns Rakesh
// reverse method can be used only on entire array not on 
// individual elements in ar

Imp Note: trim() method is used to remove empty spaces on both sides of the string
it can be used only on string variables or objects
 
 diff between string literal and string variable

console.log("Hello World"); // Directly used 
above hello world is string literal

// String variable
let greeting = "Hello World"; // Assigned from a literal --> string variable can have value from
literal, user input or some computation and string variable can be changed as shown below

console.log(greeting);

// Changing variable value
greeting = "Hi there!";
console.log(greeting);

// without using reverse method in javascript reversing order of words

Solution:

const s1 = "Rakesh earns 1cr"
const a1 = s1.split(" ")
console.log("array",a1)
let reversedArray = []
for(let i=a1.length-1;i>=0;i--)
{
    console.log(a1[i])
    reversedArray.push(a1[i])
}
const a2 = reversedArray.join(" ")
console.log("a2:",a2) // 1cr earns Rakesh




6.useReducer hook

 it is also one of the hooks for state management along with useState hook when we have a complex state
to maintain we prefer useReducer 

below I have given a simple example lets add the complex example later

App.js

import React from 'react';
import { useState, useReducer } from 'react'

function App() {
  // const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const INCREMENT = "Increment"
  const reducer = (state,action) =>
  {
    switch(action.type)
    {
      case INCREMENT:
      return {count: state.count + 1}
      default:
      return state
    }
  }
  const initialState = {count : 0}
  const [state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState)
  
  const handleIncrement = () =>
  {
    dispatch({type: INCREMENT})
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement}>
          count {state.count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App


7.how to insert elements in between indexes of an array

Sol: basically to insert elements in between using indexes we make use of splice method
  which has three arguments first argument takes in the position where element needs to be inserted,
  next argument takes the count of number of elements to be deleted from tat position if it is 0 , then
  no element gets deleted finally last argument contains the value to be inserted.

  splice method affects original array 

  example code:

   const a1= [1,2,4,5,6]
   to insert element between 4 and 5 ,
   a1.splice(3,0,6) => this means since I want to insert an element between 4 and 5,
   the first argument is 3 indicating tat element has to be inserted at index 3 and tat element is 6 which is
   the third argument, the second argument being zero indicates tat no elements needs to be deleted

   console.log(a1) // => Output --> [1,2,4,6,5,6]

learn about splice and slice method with examples ?

8.what are pseudo elements and pseudo classes

Solution: pseudo classes help us to add style to state of an element like for example a:hover , a:visited
here : is the syntax for pseudo classes where as pseudo elements style specific part of an element

for eg:
 
.p::first-line {
	
}

it means we apply style only to the first line of paragraph element and the syntax is ::

we can combine both pseduo classes and pseudo elements


eg: p:first-child::first-line {
font-weight: bold;
}


9.what are combinators

Sol: combinators in css define the relationship b/w two or more selectors
     allowing to target and style the elements based on their position in HTML structure.

 types:
1. descendant combinator
    
   div p{
   color: green; // style all the paragraph elements which are the descendants of  div
}

2. child combinator

   div > p{
    color: blue; // style only the p elements which are direct children of div
}

3. adjacent sibling combinator

   h1 + p {
   font-weight: bold; // styles only the first p which is right after an h1 meaning 
                     // once h1 tag closes and with the same parent
}

4. general sibling combinator


   h1 ~ p{
   color: yellow; // styles all the p elments which are the next siblings of specified element
   //  and share the same parent
}

// finally develop a todo app keep doing it for 5 days continously at the end

 
# definite_interview_crack_2

// get answers for left out things below start from question 5

first learn scss
  
  1. css modules
  2. styled components
  3. I need to learn styles in scss. what is mixin.
  4. tailwind css - I can learn later
  3. cross site scripting

  4. what is shallow copy and deep copy
     shallow copy - it copies only first level of object , nested objects within tat are still referenced
	 deep copy - it copies all the levels , it is completely independent of original
	 
	 example of shallow copy - 
	 
	 const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  address: { city: "New York", zip: 10001 }
};

// Shallow copy using spread operator
const shallowCopy = { ...person };

shallowCopy.name = "Bob"; // changes only the copy
shallowCopy.address.city = "Los Angeles"; // affects BOTH!

console.log(person.address.city); // Los angeles
	 
	 
	 example of deep copy - 
	 
	 const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  address: { city: "New York", zip: 10001 }
};

// Deep copy  (modern JS)
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

deepCopy.name = "Bob";
deepCopy.address.city = "Los Angeles";

console.log(person.address.city); // "New York" ✅


  5. build a UI where on click of button it shows progress building from 1% to 100%
  below I have something called queue progress bar - with count value set to 0
  on click of 5 times it shows 5 progress bars
  on click of 6 nothing happens initially after first one disappears only then the 6th one starts
  
  6. learn about middleware in redux - sagas and thunk and when they are used
  7. what is use of mixin in scss

  8. what is pure function in JS?

     1. no matter how many times you call the function if the same input is passed then the output should remain same
	 2. it has no side effects - what is side effect?
	 
	 example of pure function -
	 
	 function add(a,b) {
	   return a + b
	 }
	 
	 
	 add(5,3)
	 add(5,3)


  # definite_interview_crack_50_qns
    definite 50 qns to learn in React

1. What is React

Solution:
 React is a JS library created by fb for building UI's

 2. What is useMemo ?

Solution: 
useMemo is hook used to memoize certain expensive cALculations so tat performance is optimized

example :

import React,{useState} from 'react'

const App = () =>
{
  const [counterOne,setCounterOne] = useState(0);
const [counterTwo,setCounterTwo] = useState(0);
const isEven = () =>
{
while(i<2000000000) i++
 return counterOne % 2 === 0 
}
return(
<div>
<button onClick={()=>setCounterOne(counterOne + 1)}>Counter1 - {counterOne}</button>
<span>{isEven() ? 'Even' : 'Odd'}</span>
<button onClick={()=>setCounterTwo(counterTwo + 1)}>Counter2 - {counterTwo}</button>
</div>
)
}

export default App;

first with the above code on click of counterone button , counter1 increments slowly
bcoz of the time taking expensive calculation it is valid only but on click of counterTwo
button also there will be time delay in incrementation of counter two it is bcoz each time
counterTwo is pressed value changes and re-rendering happens and each time isEven is executed
tat's why the delay to solve it we use useMemo where we cache the result and cause re-render
only when there is change in state variable

below is the proper solution with optimization using useMemo

import React,{useState,useMemo} from 'react'

const App = () =>
{
  const [counterOne,setCounterOne] = useState(0);
const [counterTwo,setCounterTwo] = useState(0);
const isEven = useMemo(() =>
{
while(i<2000000000) i++
 return counterOne % 2 === 0 
},[counterOne])
return(
<div>
<button onClick={()=>setCounterOne(counterOne + 1)}>Counter1 - {counterOne}</button>
<span>{isEven ? 'Even' : 'Odd'}</span>
<button onClick={()=>setCounterTwo(counterTwo + 1)}>Counter2 - {counterTwo}</button>
</div>
)
}

export default App;

with the above solution the performance is improved


 

export default App;


 3. What are the features of React ?

  Solution:

 1. Virtual DOM - react maintains a lightweight copy of actual DOM and actually
    updates the virtual DOM and only then necessary changes or required changes
    get updated in real DOM(this process is called reconciliation)
 2. Component based architecture
 3. state management
 4. JSX
 5. hooks and life cycle methods 
 
 4. What is JSX ?

Solution:
It is a syntax used in React which is combination of JS and HTML. it is introduced as part of ES6

 5. What is DOM ?
Solution:

DOM represents structure of webpage and we can view it as tree of nodes

   this holds the UI 
 6. What is Virtual Dom ?

Solution:
 
react maintains a lightweight copy of actual DOM and actually
    updates the virtual DOM and only then necessary changes or required changes
    get updated in real DOM(this process is called reconciliation)

 7. What is component life cycle of React class component ?

Solution:

each component in its life cycle goes through 1. Mounting , 2.Updating and 3. Unmounting

and we have life cycle methods associated with it
 8. What are fragments in react ?
  
 9. What are props in react ?
Solution:
Props are objects and they are like arguments which
we pass to function , they are passed from child to parent and vice versa
 10. What are synthetic events in react ?
 11. What are the difference between Package.json and Package.lock.json ?
 12. What are the differences between client side and server side rendering ?
 13. What is state in Reactjs?
